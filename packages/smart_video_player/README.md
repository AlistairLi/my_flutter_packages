# smart_video_player

A simple video player widget for Flutter applications with enhanced playback controls and features.

## Features

### 1. **Video Source Types**
- Supports three video source types:
    - `asset` (local app bundle)
    - `file` (local file)
    - `network` (URL or network stream)

### 2. **Player Configuration**
- Customize the video display using the `BoxFit` parameter (e.g., `contain`, `cover`, etc.).
- Supports **click-to-play/pause** functionality, which can be enabled or disabled via the `clickPlay` parameter.
- Has a `keepAlive` feature to keep the widget alive even when it's not visible.

### 3. **Controller Integration**
- Uses a custom `SmartVideoPlayerController` for controlling playback states, which can either be passed externally or internally managed.

### 4. **Audio Session**
- Integrates with `audio_session` for proper audio management, particularly during media playback.

### 5. **Playback Control**
- The player automatically plays and loops the video.
- Playback can be paused or played with a single tap.
- Audio volume can be controlled (range: 0.0 to 1.0).

### 6. **Visibility Detection**
- The video will pause when the widget goes off-screen and resume playing when visible, using the `VisibilityDetectorWidget`.

### 7. **UI Elements**
- A loading indicator (`CircularProgressIndicator`) is shown while the video is loading.
- A play button is displayed in the center when the video is paused, which can be tapped to start playing.

### 8. **Lifecycle Management**
- Ensures proper initialization and cleanup, including removing listeners when the widget is disposed of.


In summary, the `SmartVideoPlayer` is a flexible and interactive video player that supports various video sources, controls playback, manages audio, and integrates visibility detection for a seamless user experience.
